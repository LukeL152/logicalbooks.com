    <h2>Sole prop/LLC (taxed as disregarded entity)</h2>
    <p>You typically take an <em>owner draw</em>—that’s equity, not an expense. Plan a monthly draw and set aside taxes (quarterly estimates are your friend).</p>

    <h2>S‑Corp</h2>
    <p>Owners who work in the business usually take a <em>reasonable salary</em> via payroll and may take additional <em>distributions</em> when profits allow. Keep payroll consistent; distributions should follow clean, reconciled months.</p>

    <h2>Keep it clean</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Separate accounts: no personal spending on the business card.</li>
      <li>Decide a cadence: weekly, twice‑monthly, or monthly.</li>
      <li>Run payroll for salaries; route draws/distributions as equity, not expenses.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Not sure what’s right for your entity and stage? We’ll coordinate with your CPA to set the right approach and keep the books tidy.</p>
