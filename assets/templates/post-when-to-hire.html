    <p>Here are the patterns we see when teams are ready for professional bookkeeping.</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Closes slip or never quite “finish.”</strong> Month‑end lingers into mid‑month. You’re waiting on reconciliations to answer basic questions.</li>
      <li><strong>Founder time drain.</strong> You’re spending 4–6+ hours a week in the books. That’s time you could spend on sales or product.</li>
      <li><strong>Cash surprises.</strong> A bill hits unexpectedly or receivables stack up. Forecasting feels fuzzy.</li>
      <li><strong>Tax season stress.</strong> Your CPA flags gaps or asks for clarifications that take hours to track down.</li>
      <li><strong>Raising or borrowing.</strong> Lenders and investors expect clean, accrual‑based statements and consistent processes.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>What a bookkeeper actually does</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Builds a simple monthly rhythm: import, categorize, reconcile, review, and report.</li>
      <li>Preps useful reports (P&amp;L, balance sheet, cash flow) and answers “what changed?”</li>
      <li>Sets up light controls so money moves with fewer surprises.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The goal isn’t just tidy books—it’s decision‑ready visibility. If you’re seeing these signals, it’s time. We can stand up a reliable close and keep you focused on growth.
