    <p>
      The method you choose determines when revenue and expenses hit your books.
      It affects taxes, margins, and how “true” your month‑to‑month results look.
    </p>
    <h2>Cash accounting (simple and literal)</h2>
    <p>
      You record income when money lands in your bank account and expenses when money leaves. It’s easy to maintain and aligns with cash on hand.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Great for: early‑stage businesses, solo founders, low complexity.</li>
      <li>Watch out for: lumpy results if invoices or bills cross month‑end.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Accrual accounting (accurate timing)</h2>
    <p>
      You record income when it’s earned (invoice issued or work delivered) and expenses when they’re incurred, regardless of when cash moves. This smooths results and supports clean comparisons.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Great for: B2B invoicing, subscriptions, inventory, and growth stages.</li>
      <li>Watch out for: slightly more process (invoices, A/R, A/P, and cutoffs).</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Which should you choose?</h2>
    <p>
      If you’re just getting started and need simplicity, cash works fine. If you’re sending invoices, carrying inventory, or sharing numbers with investors or lenders, accrual will tell a clearer story.
    </p>
    <h3>Quick decision checklist</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Do you invoice customers or ship products across month‑end? → Accrual.</li>
      <li>Running lean, few transactions, want easy tax prep? → Cash.</li>
      <li>Planning to raise money or borrow? → Accrual will be expected.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Many teams start on cash, then switch to accrual once growth introduces timing gaps. We can help you evaluate timing, plan a clean conversion, and keep tax implications in view.
